            Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user’s task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.

            Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard.

Using appropriate terminology specific to the user’s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.

           Use of “white space”: “White space” on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded.

           Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.

          Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.

           Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.

           Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient.

                    Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.

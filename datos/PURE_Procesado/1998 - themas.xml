 The THEMAS system shall maintain the ON/OFF status of each
 heating and cooling unit. When a request to turn on or off a
 heating or cooling unit, the following processing will occur.
 When a request to turn on a heating or cooling unit is received,
 the system shall determine if the request can be honored. If the
 maximum number of heating or cooling units is already running,
 the request will be added to a LIFO queue. If the maximum number
 of heating or cooling units is not running, this process will
 generate a request to turn on the requested unit.
 When a request to turn off a heating or cooling unit is received,
 this process shall check the queue of waiting heating and cooling
 requests. If the queue is not empty, this process shall remove
 one request from the LIFO queue and check the current state of
 the thermostat for which the queued request was made. If that
 thermostat still needs a heating o r cooling unit turned on, this
 process shall submit a request to turn that unit on.

 If the system detects a temperature limit has been exceeded, this

 the supervisor’s interface window.

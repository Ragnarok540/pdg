 The system will be capable of controlling the Predator and Outrider AVs with a single control system,
 using existing military services standard hardware and software, and supporting interfaces with various
 C4I systems.
 The system shall consist of the system workstation Hardware Configuration Items (HWCIs), system Computer
 Software Configuration Items (CSCIs), and additional system Support HWCIs and CSCIs.
 All system HWCI’s and CSCI’s shall be Year 2000 compliant.
 The primary function of the system is to provide command and control of the payload, Air Vehicle (AV), data
 link, and other necessary support equipment in order to employ tactical UAVs to conduct reconnaissance,
 surveillance, target acquisition, and target identification missions. The system will interface with and export
 and disseminate payload data to military supported units via external (not part of system) tactical
 communications systems, and C4I systems. Communications procedures, formats, and interfaces will be
 interoperable with selected standard DoD C4I systems, architectures, and protocols.
 The operational capabilities to be performed by the system will be determined by task analysis in
 accordance with MIL STD 1388 Task 401 as a guide based on a thorough understanding of Outrider and
 Predator mission requirements. Tasks will be evaluated and allocated based on operator skills and
 proficiencies. The initial system task analysis will produce a system baseline which will be optimized by
 engineering analysis and operator evaluations.
 The system shall meet the applicable capability and characteristic criteria established by the Operational
 Requirements Document (ORD) CAF 003-90-I-A for the RQ-1A Predator Medium Altitude Endurance
 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle/System (MAE UAV) and the Close Range – Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
 (CR-TUAV). Appendix B and C identify applicable capability and characteristic criteria to
 system.

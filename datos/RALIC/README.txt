SUMMARY
==========================================

The RALIC project datasets were collected by Soo Ling Lim at the University College 
London (UCL).

The datasets consist of:

   * 1714 recommendations from 61 stakeholders (OpenR)

   * 839 recommendations from 50 stakeholders (ClosedR)

   * 439 ratings from 76 stakeholders on 10 project objectives (RateP-Obj)

   * 1514 ratings from the same 76 stakeholders on 48 requirements (RateP-Req)

   * 3113 ratings from the same 76 stakeholders on 104 specific requiremnets (RateP-SReq)

   * 262 ratings from 79 stakeholders on 10 project objectives (RankP-Obj)

   * 469 ratings from the same 79 stakeholders on 51 requirements (RankP-Req)

   * 1109 ratings from the same 79 stakeholders on 132 specific requirements (RankP-SReq)

   * 276 ratings from 77 stakeholders on 10 project objectives (PointP-Obj)

   * 670 ratings from the same 77 stakeholders on 45 requirements (PointP-Req)

   * 1219 ratings from the same 77 stakeholders on 83 specific requirements (PointP-SReq)

   * 410 raw textual description of requirements provided by stakeholders (Raw-requirements)

   * stakeholders and their roles (Stakeholders-and-roles)

Recommendations are in the format <recommender, recommendee, level of influence>. 
Level of influence for OpenR is between 1 and 8 inclusive.
Level of influence for ClosedR is between 1 and 10 inclusive.

Ratings are in the format <stakeholder name, item, rating>. 
An item is either a project objective, requirement or specific requirement. 
A rating in RateP datasets is an integer i, where -1 <= i <= 5.
A rating in RankP datasets is a real number r, where 0 <= r <= 1.
A rating in PointP datasets is a real number r, where 0 < r <= 100.


The datasets were collected using questionnaires which are available at:
